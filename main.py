# understanding variables and data types
# creating variables is easy , write variable name then = and then the value
name = zach
age = 41
height = 5.4
# above delcares three variables , name which is a string , age is an int and height is a float
# the = is called an "assignment operator"
# basically stands for assign the value to the right of the variable
# variables must start with a letter or underscore
# they can contain letters , numbers and underscores
# are case sensitive
# examples of good variables myVariable , _temp , AGE
# not good variables 1var , my-variable , For
# Data types
# Integers - whole numbers
# Floats - decimal numbers
# Strings - text enclosed in quotes
# Booleans - True or False values used for conditonal statements
# Integer
integer_example = 5
# float
float_example = 3.14
# string
string_example = "Good Morning!"
# boolean
boolean_example = True
# different types of variables can be converted between different types
age = 41  #integer
age_as_string = str(age) #it's a string now

# Examples:
# create a variable called my_name and assign your name to it
my_name = Zach
# create another variable called my_age
my_age = 41
# multiply my_age by 2 and store the result in a new variable called double_age
double_age = my_age *2

# Basic operators
# Addition
result = 3 + 4  #result is 7
# Subtraction
result = 4 - 3  #result is 1
# Multiplication
result = 4 * 3  #result is 12
# Division
result = 10 / 2  #result is 5
# Floor division
result = 9 // 2  #result is 4
# Modulus
result = 9 % 2   #result is 1
# Exponentiation
result = 3 ** 2  #result is 9
# arithmetic operators work with variables too
a = 5
b = 2
addition = a + b  #result is 7

# comparison operators help us make decisions in our code by comparing values
# (==)  Equal to
# !=    Not equal to
# >     Greater than
# <     Less than
# >=    greater than or equal to
# <=    less than or equal to

# logical operators are used to combine condtional statements
# and  And
# or   or
# not  not
# order of operations is important always us parentthese in your code
